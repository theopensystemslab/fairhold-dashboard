### Fairhold Land Purchase
The resale value of a Fairhold lease rises according to the consumer price index, assumed here as a steady {{constructionPriceGrowthPerYear}}%.

As the house is treated as a consumer durable, its price depreciates over time and depreciation is countered by maintenance spend. For more on how depreciation is calculated, see [source code](https://github.com/theopensystemslab/fairhold-dashboard).

### Fairhold Land Rent
No land resale value is included since community ground rent is paid monthly. Resale value only represents the house.
