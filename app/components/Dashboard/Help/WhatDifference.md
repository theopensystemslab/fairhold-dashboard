### Money saved
The total cost of a Fairhold Land Purchase mortgage is compared to the total cost of a freehold, using the parameters displayed in the form: {{DEFAULT_INTEREST_RATE}}% interest rate, {{DEFAULT_MORTGAGE_TERM}} year mortgage term and {{DEFAULT_INITIAL_DEPOSIT}}% initial deposit. 

### Community wealth
This recalculates Fairhold Land Rent yearly, assuming rising property prices at a rate of {{propertyPriceGrowthPerYear}}% per year and incomes at {{incomeGrowthPerYear}}%.

### Embodied carbon savings
Fairhold homes must be net zero embodied carbon; brick and block is assumed for the 'typical' house for comparison. 

### Energy savings
A retrofitted home is compared to the typical existing home, calculating heating demand by kwh/m2 by house type. Gas demand and retrofit figures from [LETI and Studio PDP](https://studiopdp.com/blog/retrofit-six-key-principles), gas prices from the [Department for Energy Security and Net Zero](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/annual-domestic-energy-price-statistics#history)

### Savings to NHS
Costs to the NHS and to society more broadly are taken from a [BRE report](https://files.bregroup.com/research/BRE_Report_the_cost_of_poor_housing_2021.pdf). They have been individualised according to the [English Housing Survey 2021-2022](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-housing-survey-2021-to-2022-housing-quality-and-condition/english-housing-survey-2021-to-2022-housing-quality-and-condition#:~:text=There%20are%203.5%20million%20households,a%20home%20with%20damp%20problems.).

### Local economy
Base build cost and added yearly maintenance spend is divided by Â£60k, the assumed cost of one full-time equivalent role. 

### Annual carbon savings
Carbon demand calculated using kwh/m2 by house type figures above and [Carbon Independent](https://www.carbonindependent.org/15.html#:~:text=Natural%20gas&text=Older%20gas%20meters%20measure%20gas,kg%20%2F%20kWh%20%5B9%5D%20)'s kg of CO2 per kwh figure.
