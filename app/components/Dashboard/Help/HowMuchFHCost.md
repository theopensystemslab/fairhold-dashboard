### Freehold
Average market price for the area is taken from [Land Registry Price Paid](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/price-paid-data) dataset (2022). Construction cost is from [CostModelling](https://costmodelling.com/building-costs), retrieved in 2023.

### Fairhold - Land Purchase
Fairhold separates the cost of the house from the cost of the land underneath it. Homes are treated as consumer durables, which means that maintenance and improvement push real value up, while usage and time means real value falls. 

Land is discounted using a formula that takes local property prices and incomes into account.

### Fairhold - Land Rent
The up-front purchase price of a Fairhold Land Rent property only accounts for the consumer durable home. Land is paid for via community ground rent, and so is not an up-front cost.
